\chapter{Source code acquisition}

The implementation acquires source code by following the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The entire source file is read as a sequence of bytes from now on
        referred to as \var{source}.
  \item If \var{source} is not a UTF-8 encoding, the program is ill-formed.
  \item Every instance of \cp{000D} followed by \cp{000A} in \var{source} is
        replaced by \cp{000A}. The result of this operation is from now on
        referred to as \var{source}.
  \item If \var{source} contains a code point in one of the ranges
        [\cp{0000}, \cp{0009}] and [\cp{000B}, \cp{001F}], the program is
        ill-formed.
\end{enumerate}

The acquired source code is what is now known as \var{source}.
